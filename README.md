# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

These are my solutions to the exercises in SICP, a reading project I began in January 2019 and completed in February 2020.

SICP is a truly enlightening experience. The book provides a tour of the truly big ideas in programming and guides the reader through several challenging projects, including a picture language, a symbolic differentiation program, a rational arithmetic package, a constraint-propagation system, a metacircular evaluator for Scheme written in Scheme, a virtual register-machine simulator with its own pseudo-assembly language, and a compiler from Scheme to this pseudo-assembly language.

SICP is a long journey, but one I'd recommend to anyone who wants to discover or rediscover the ideas that allow ordinary humans, as Sussman and Abelson write, to "conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells."
